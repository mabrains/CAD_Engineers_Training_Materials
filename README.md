* You need to find all bins in Skywater 130nm for nfet_1v8 and pfet_1v8 from the models using either python or linux commands.

## Open Source Analog Design for Engineers (Required only for Analog Designers / Analog Design Automation full timers)
You will need to install the following tools and procedure is outlined as follows:
* [Introduction to Model Binning](http://literature.cdn.keysight.com/litweb/pdf/iccap2008addon2/icmdl/icmdl05a11.html)
* [CMOS Analog Integrated Circuit Design Fundamentals](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUJOuapA83-QlWbnMJvoyQucGaBlpBF0F)
  - Need to watch until video 7.
* [Xschem Tutorial](https://xschem.sourceforge.io/stefan/xschem_man/xschem_man.html)
  - You need to watch all videos including skywater installation. But you don't need to do the installation.
* [Ng-spice Manual](http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/docs/ngspice-35-manual.pdf)
  - You need to write a small netlist with R/C filter and simulate AC simulation and send me plots.
  - You need to write a small netlist of voltage divider and simulat DC simulation and send me results.
  - You need to read the manual and understand different simulation types available.
* You need to design a Millar compensated OTA with a minimum of 40 dB Gain with single output using Skywater PDK.
* Review the design methodology and the automation scripts in [Analog Blocks By Mabrains](https://github.com/mabrains/Analog_blocks)

## Open Source Digital Design for Engineers (Required only for Digital Designers / Digital Design Engineers)
